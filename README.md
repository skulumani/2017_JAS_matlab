Matlab code for the Poincare reachability. 

This code was used to generate the results for the 2015 AAS conference and also extended for use in the submission to Acta Astronautica.

I also forked this repo and it's now being used for the 2017 JAS submission.

The results were used in the following places

1. https://shankarkulumani@bitbucket.org/shankarkulumani/acta-astronautica.git
2. https://shankarkulumani@bitbucket.org/shankarkulumani/2015-aas-presentation.git
3. https://shankarkulumani@bitbucket.org/shankarkulumani/2015-aas-manuscript.git
4. https://github.com/skulumani/2015-AAS-presentation
5. https://github.com/skulumani/2015_AAS

## IMPORTANT

There are several large files which are not tracked in `git`, instead these are backed up to Google Drive. 

Make sure you do not overwrite/delete files on Google drive, but rather only pull.
